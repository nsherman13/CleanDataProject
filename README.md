# CleanDataProject
The run analysis file reads,combines and filters on specific columns to create a tidy dataset. I have broken it step by step to make this easier to read.

Assumptions
1) Zip extracted to working directory + UCI HAR"... folder renamed to "data".
2) All columns that end with mean and std should be part of final tidy dataset.
3) Tidy data form is wide.
